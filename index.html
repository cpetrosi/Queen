<!-- Welcome to Queen!

Queen is a JavaScript ES6 language with OCaml's pattern matching and first class functions.
Coders everywhere can create and complete projects on their smartphones while enjoying the
expressiveness of emojis. Queen is also a great way to excite kids about computer science,
once they see how fun and creative it can be! We hope you enjoy seeing your functions come
to life as much as we do! -->
